I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements.  I had the correct configuration and imports set up, but the styles weren't rendering.  Inspecting the elements showed that the Tailwind classes were present in the HTML, but the corresponding CSS wasn't being applied.
