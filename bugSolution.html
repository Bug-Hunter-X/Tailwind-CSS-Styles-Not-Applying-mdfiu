The issue was resolved by ensuring that the `tailwind.config.js` file was correctly configured to include the necessary content and that the `purge` option was used to remove unused CSS.  Additionally,  I verified that the build process correctly included the generated CSS file. The corrected files are in `bugSolution.html`.  This solution involved reviewing Tailwind CSS documentation, particularly the sections on configuration and purging unused styles.
